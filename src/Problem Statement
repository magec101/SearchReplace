Write a Program which takes input as 3 strings namely: Main String, Search String, Replace String.
The Program searches for the 'Search String' in the 'Main String' and if found, replaces it with the 'Replace String'. 
The Program prints the modified 'Main String' as the Output. 
For example, Inputs: Main String : Concatenate Search String: cat Replace String: mat Expected Output: Conmatenate
